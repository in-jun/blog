### What is the N+1 Problem?

The **N+1 problem** is a common performance issue in Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) where N additional queries are executed to retrieve associated entities for each associated entity when querying. As a result, the number of queries becomes N+1. A high number of queries can lead to increased communication with the database and can result in degraded performance.

Therefore, the **N+1 problem** is a concern that requires attention when optimizing performance.

### How it Works

1. The first query retrieves the entities.

```java
List<Member> members = memberRepository.findAll();
```

2. For each retrieved entity, additional queries are executed when used.

```java
for (Member member : members) {
    System.out.println(member.getTeam().getName());
}
```

3. Additional queries are executed equal to the number of associated entities.

```sql
SELECT * FROM Team WHERE team_id = 1;
SELECT * FROM Team WHERE team_id = 2;
SELECT * FROM Team WHERE team_id = 3;
...
```

### Solution

> Attempting to solve the N+1 problem using Eager Loading can lead to poor performance. Therefore, it is recommended to use Fetch Join, Batch Fetch, EntityGraph, etc.

The following are ways to solve the **N+1 problem**:

1. **Using Fetch Join**: Retrieve the associated entities together.

```java
@Query("SELECT m FROM Member m JOIN FETCH m.team")
List<Member> findAllWithTeam();
```

2. **Using Batch Fetch**: Retrieve the associated entities in bulk.

```java
@Entity
public class Member {
    @ManyToOne(fetch = FetchType.LAZY)
    @BatchSize(size = 100)
    private Team team;
}
```

3. **Using EntityGraph**: Retrieve the associated entities together.

```java
// This method is supported in JPA 2.1 and later.
@EntityGraph(attributePaths = {"team"})
@Query("SELECT m FROM Member m")
List<Member> findAllWithTeam();
```

### Conclusion

The **N+1 problem** is a performance issue that occurs when retrieving associated entities. To resolve this issue, methods such as **Fetch Join**, **Batch Fetch**, and **EntityGraph** can be used to retrieve associated entities together or in bulk.
