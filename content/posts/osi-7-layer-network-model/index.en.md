The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) 7-layer model is a conceptual framework that divides the process of network communication into seven distinct layers. Standardized by the ISO in 1984, it serves as the reference model for modern networks.

## Layer 7 - Application Layer

The layer closest to the user, the Application Layer is where the user-facing applications we interact with operate.

**Key Protocols:**

-   HTTP: Web service communication
-   FTP: File transfer
-   SMTP: Email transfer
-   DNS: Domain name resolution

**Practical Use Cases:**

-   Accessing websites with a web browser
-   Sending and receiving emails
-   Downloading/uploading files

## Layer 6 - Presentation Layer

The Presentation Layer defines the format of the data, including encryption/decryption and encoding/decoding.

**Key Functions:**

-   Image conversions (e.g., JPEG, GIF)
-   Audio conversions (e.g., MIDI, WAV)
-   Character encoding (e.g., ASCII, EBCDIC)
-   SSL/TLS encryption

**Practical Use Cases:**

-   Encryption during HTTPS communication
-   Image file format conversions
-   Character set conversions (e.g., UTF-8, EUC-KR)

## Layer 5 - Session Layer

The Session Layer manages communication sessions, handling connection initiation, termination, and synchronization.

**Key Functions:**

-   Session establishment and termination
-   Session recovery
-   Synchronization and checkpoints

**Practical Use Cases:**

-   Maintaining login status
-   Database connection management
-   Real-time streaming connections

## Layer 4 - Transport Layer

The Transport Layer ensures reliable data transfer between endpoints (end-to-end).

**Key Protocols:**

-   TCP: Reliable, connection-oriented
-   UDP: Fast, connectionless

**Practical Use Cases:**

-   Web browsing (TCP)
-   Video streaming (UDP)
-   Game server communication (UDP)

## Layer 3 - Network Layer

The Network Layer handles packet routing, determining the path packets take.

**Key Protocols:**

-   IP: Packet delivery
-   ICMP: Error reporting
-   OSPF: Routing

**Practical Use Cases:**

-   IP address-based communication
-   Route determination via routers
-   Inter-subnet communication

## Layer 2 - Data Link Layer

The Data Link Layer ensures reliable transmission between adjacent nodes.

**Key Protocols:**

-   Ethernet: Wired LAN
-   WiFi: Wireless LAN
-   PPP: Point-to-point connections

**Practical Use Cases:**

-   MAC address-based communication
-   LAN setup via switches
-   Wireless network connections

## Layer 1 - Physical Layer

The Physical Layer defines the physical medium over which data is transmitted.

**Key Mediums:**

-   Fiber optic cables
-   Twisted pair cables
-   Radio frequencies

**Practical Use Cases:**

-   Network cable connections
-   WiFi antenna communication
-   Optical fiber communication

## Conclusion

The OSI 7-layer model provides a step-by-step understanding of the entire process of network communication. While each layer operates independently, they work collectively to enable data transfer and communication.
