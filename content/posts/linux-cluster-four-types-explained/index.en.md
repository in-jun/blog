Linux cluster systems are a critical part of the infrastructure of many businesses and research institutions. Depending on the purpose and usage, they can be broadly classified into 4 types. Let's have a look at the characteristics and real-world use cases for each of these types.

## What is a Cluster System?

A cluster system is a group of computers connected through a network that act as a single system. It can be set up for various purposes such as high performance, high availability, and load balancing.

## 1. High Availability (HA) Cluster

These are used in mission-critical systems in businesses that need to provide services 24/7 without any downtime.

### Key Characteristics

- Automatically switches over to another system in case of a failure
- Can be configured as Active-Active or Active-Standby
- Monitors the health of the system with real-time monitoring

### Use Cases

- Core banking systems in the financial industry
- E-commerce platforms
- Enterprise mail servers

## 2. Beowulf Cluster

These are low-cost, high-performance clusters that are built by connecting commodity PCs to achieve supercomputing-like performance.

### Key Characteristics

- Uses commodity hardware to reduce costs
- Based on Linux, eliminating the need for licensing costs
- Simple network configuration using Ethernet

### Use Cases

- Simulation environments in university labs
- R&D centers in small and medium businesses
- Educational cluster systems

## 3. HPC (High-Performance Computing) Cluster

These are supercomputing-class clusters that provide the highest levels of computing power.

### Key Characteristics

- Uses high-performance processors and ultra-fast networks
- Capable of massively parallel processing
- Provides high-performance distributed storage

### Use Cases

- Weather forecasting systems in meteorological departments
- New drug development environments in pharmaceutical companies
- Crash simulations in automobile companies

## 4. HTC (High-Throughput Computing) Cluster

These are clusters optimized for efficiently handling large numbers of jobs.

### Key Characteristics

- Processes multiple independent jobs simultaneously
- Provides efficient job scheduling
- Easy to scale

### Use Cases

- Big data analytics platforms
- Render farms
- Large-scale log analysis environments
