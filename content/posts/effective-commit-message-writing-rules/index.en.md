In software development, version control is an essential aspect. Among its various components, commit messages play a pivotal role in maintaining project history and facilitating seamless team collaboration. Well-written commit messages not only ease code reviews but also simplify bug tracking and enhance the overall quality of a project. In this article, we will delve into the guidelines for writing effective commit messages and explore their significance.

### 1. Separate Subject from Body: Convey Crisp Information

A commit message should be structured with a subject and a body. This enables a quick grasp of the gist and allows for detailed inspection when necessary.

-   Keep the subject line within 50 characters, providing an at-a-glance summary of the change.
-   Separate the subject from the body with a blank line for visual distinction.
-   Wrap the body text at 72 characters per line to enhance readability.

Example:

```
feat: Implement user authentication system

Enhance user experience and site security by adding secure login and signup functionalities.
- Created responsive login and signup forms with client-side validation
- Set up a user database schema with hashed passwords
- Implemented JWT token-based authentication for stateless, secure sessions
- Added password reset functionality via email verification
```

Such a structured message clearly conveys both the gist of the change and its specifics.

### 2. Subject in Imperative Mood: Maintain Consistency and Directness

Writing commit subjects in the imperative mood ensures consistency and direct conveyance of the message.

-   Good examples: "feat: Add feature", "fix: Critical bug resolved", "refactor: User module refactored"
-   Avoid: "Feature added", "Fixing a bug", "User module refactoring done"

Imperative subjects explicitly state "applying this commit will do this."

### 3. Omit Period in Subject: Aim for Conciseness

Refrain from using a period at the end of the subject line to reduce unnecessary characters and maintain conciseness. A period is redundant in a short subject line.

### 4. Focus on 'What' and 'Why' in Body: Provide Context

Describe the motivation and impact of the change to help fellow developers understand the context behind it.

-   Reason for code change: Explain why this change was needed.
-   Impact of change: Elaborate on how this change affects the project.
-   Limitations and caveats: Mention any known issues or areas for future improvement.

For instance:

```
refactor: Optimize user dashboard database queries

Loading time for user dashboards with 1000+ items currently exceeds 5 seconds.
This refactor:
- Implements database indexing for frequently accessed fields.
- Replaces multiple queries with a single optimized query.
- Introduces caching for repetitive data.

Performance tests show a 70% reduction in loading time.
Note: New indexes may slightly increase database size.
```

These details offer valuable insights for code reviewers and future developers.

### 5. Specify Commit Type: Allow Quick Categorization and Comprehension

Indicate the type of change by prefixing the commit message subject to instantly grasp the nature of the change.

-   feat: New feature addition
-   fix: Bug resolution
-   docs: Documentation modification
-   style: Code formatting, missing semicolons, etc. (no code change)
-   refactor: Code refactoring
-   test: Addition or modification of test code
-   chore: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

Example: `feat: Add OAuth2 integration for social login`

This practice is particularly beneficial in large-scale projects for easy categorization and tracking of changes.

### 6. Communicate and Enforce Guidelines Within the Team

It is crucial for the entire team to share and consistently follow these commit message guidelines. Documenting these guidelines in the project's CONTRIBUTING.md file and enforcing them during code reviews can help.

### Conclusion

Writing good commit messages goes beyond mere adherence to guidelines; it offers substantial value to the project and the team:

1. **Enhanced Project History Quality**: Clear commit messages make it effortless to understand the project's evolution.
2. **Increased Collaboration Efficiency**: Team members can more readily comprehend and review each other's work.
3. **Reduced Troubleshooting Time**: Related commits can be quickly located when tracking bugs or analyzing features.
4. **Improved Code Quality**: The act of contemplating changes fosters better overall code quality.

Commit message writing, though seemingly a minor aspect of the development process, profoundly impacts project success and team productivity in the long run. Cultivating this practice is an important step in advancing as a professional developer and contributes to building better software.
